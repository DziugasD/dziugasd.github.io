          Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin (22 April
          1870 – 21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary,
          politician and political theorist. He served as head of government of
          Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to
          1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union
          became a one-party communist state governed by the Russian Communist
          Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known
          as Leninism.

          Joseph Stalin (born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili; 18 December 1878
          – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet revolutionary and politician of Georgian
          ethnicity. He ruled the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his
          death in 1953, holding the titles of General Secretary of the
          Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952 and the nation's
          Premier from 1941 to 1953. Initially presiding over an oligarchic
          one-party regime that governed by plurality, he became the de facto
          dictator of the Soviet Union by the 1930s. Ideologically committed to
          the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin helped to formalise
          these ideas as Marxism–Leninism while his own policies became known as
          Stalinism.

          The term comrade is used to mean "friend", "mate", "colleague", or
          "ally", and derives from the Iberian Romance language term camarada,
          literally meaning "chamber mate", from Latin camera "chamber" or
          "room". A political use of the term was inspired by the French
          Revolution, after which it grew into a form of address between
          socialists and workers. Ever since the Russian Revolution, popular
          media in the Western World have often associated it with Communism.
